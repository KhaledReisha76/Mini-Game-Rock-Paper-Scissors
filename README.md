# Rock-Paper-Scissors Mini-Game in C++

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Rock-Paper-Scissors mini-game! This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic game developed entirely in C++. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking for a fun diversion, a student learning the ropes of programming, or just a game enthusiast interested in how games can be created using basic programming concepts, this project is for you.

## Game Overview

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a well-known hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:
- **Rock** (a fist)
- **Paper** (an open hand)
- **Scissors** (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The winner is determined by the rules:
- Rock crushes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock

This game is a great example of using simple logic and conditional statements in programming. Our version is designed to be played in the command line, where you will compete against the computer.

## Features

- **Easy to Play**: Simple command line interface that anyone can use.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, just compile and run.
- **Educational**: A good starter project for those new to C++ or programming in general.

We hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed creating it!
